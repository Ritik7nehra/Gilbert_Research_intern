## Introduction : 

Companies often receive thousands of resumes for each job posting and employ dedicated screening officers to screen qualified candidates.

Hiring the right talent is a challenge for all businesses. This challenge is magnified by the high volume of applicants if the business is labour-intensive, growing, and facing high attrition rates.
IT departments are short of growing markets. In a typical service organization, professionals with a variety of technical skills and business domain expertise are hired and assigned to projects to resolve customer issues. This task of selecting the best talent among many others is known as Resume Screening.

Typically, large companies do not have enough time to open each CV, so they use machine learning algorithms for the Resume Screening task.

## The Solution: 

Our project offers a comprehensive solution to streamline the resume screening process using machine learning. By harnessing the power of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms, we automate the categorization of resumes based on predefined criteria. Additionally, our system provides personalized job recommendations to match candidates with suitable job openings, optimizing the recruitment process.


## Conclusion:

Machine learning has revolutionized the way we approach resume screening, offering unparalleled efficiency, accuracy, and scalability. Our end-to-end project demonstrates the transformative potential of machine learning in the recruitment process, empowering organizations to make data-driven hiring decisions and unlock the full potential of their workforce.
